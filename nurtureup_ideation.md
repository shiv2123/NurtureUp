## ✨ Core Experience Pillars

| Pillar                  | What It Feels Like                                                                                             | Why It Matters                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Family Timeline**     | A living scrapbook of photos, “firsts,” and funny quotes, auto‑organized by date.                              | Parents often lose track of little moments; this keeps memories in one place. |
| **Chore Quests**        | Chores appear as bite‑sized “missions”; finishing them showers stars, cheers, and virtual confetti.            | Kids respond to games better than nagging; parents get tasks done.            |
| **Learning Arcade**     | Micro‑quizzes and mini‑lessons feel like casual games; correct answers top‑up points.                          | Converts screen time into brain time.                                         |
| **Screen‑Time Balance** | A meter shows how many “fun minutes” are left; kids can *earn* extra time with good deeds.                     | Lets families negotiate limits without meltdowns.                             |
| **Reward Marketplace**  | Stars convert to Coins that buy real perks—movie night coupons, toy store vouchers, or an extra bedtime story. | Gives abstract points tangible meaning, teaching budgeting along the way.     |
| **Community & Events**  | A safe board for parenting hacks, local kid‑friendly events, and group challenges.                             | Social proof and new ideas keep engagement fresh.                             |
